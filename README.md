# Hi, Torben Jost here! :raising_hand:üë®‚Äçüíª

With my background in visual arts, I'm a Web Developer who merges **technical and creative skills**. I embrace **interdisciplinary collaboration**, **analytical thinking**, and can't help but have a little soft spot for all things UX/UI design. To put all this on a solid technological foundation I recently completed immersive bootcamps in **Java** and **Web Development**.

## Tech-Stack

**Frontend**  
HTML ‚Ä¢ CSS ‚Ä¢ JavaScript (ES6+) ‚Ä¢ TypeScript ‚Ä¢ React ‚Ä¢ Next.js

**Backend**  
Java ‚Ä¢ Spring Boot ‚Ä¢ Node.js ‚Ä¢ MongoDB ‚Ä¢ RESTful APIs ‚Ä¢ Async Programming

**Tools**  
Git ‚Ä¢ VS Code ‚Ä¢ IntelliJ ‚Ä¢ Shell ‚Ä¢ Vercel

Feel free to explore my pinned projects below ‚Äî a mix of:
- **Java + Spring Boot + React** apps  
- **Next.js full-stack** applications.

**I am very much looking forward to hear from you üåê**
